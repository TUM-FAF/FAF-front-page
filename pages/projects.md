## FAF Lectures

FAF students believe that we can become better by involving in extracurricular activities, where we learn from each other experiences. FAF Lectures are this kind of events, where students and alumni “bring” their best knowledge regarding relevant, innovative and useful topics in order to share it through lectures where they held presentations toward other students. Lectures are made to be simple, interesting, useful and funny, covering the main details from theory part to the demo. This is how we see efficient extracurricular studies.

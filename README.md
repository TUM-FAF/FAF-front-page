# FAF Front Page :sunglasses:

English Taught Honors Program in Computer Science of the Technical University of Moldova aka FAF is now an NGO and thus we need a new site.
This repo contains all the code for our landing page, [here](http://faf.utm.md).
Perhaps it doesn't work, because we're not done, so stay tuned, or even better - contribute :smile:.

## Dependencies
We're building our landing page using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). For now seems that that's all, eventually, we might add some more, because of JS and #shinyNewToys. Besides, we use pure ES6, without any JS features not-yet-in-the-standard-spec.

## Start project
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
Quite so.

## How to contribute
Ask one of the core contributors to add you to the project, or just submit a pool request. Or kindly ask [Alex Burlacu](https://github.com/AlexandruBurlacu).

Our great core contributors are [Dragoș Străinu](http://github.com/strdr4605/), [Victor Colța](https://github.com/ColVic/) and [Vasile Drumea](https://github.com/Wazea). Want to join them? :smirk:

<h3 id="the-rebble-terms-of-service">The Rebble Terms of Service</h3>
<p>Effective date: June 26, 2018</p>

<h3 id="a-definitions">A. Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There’s not going to be a test on it, but it’s still useful information.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the “Terms”) and all other operating rules, policies (including the Rebble Privacy Statement, available at <a href="https://rebble.io/privacy">https://rebble.io/privacy</a>) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.</li>
  <li>The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Rebble.</li>
  <li>The “Website” refers to Rebble’s website located at <a href="https://rebble.io/">rebble.io</a>, and all content, services, and products provided by Rebble at or through the Website. It also refers to Rebble-owned subdomains of rebble.io, such as <a href="https://auth.rebble.io">auth.rebble.io</a> and <a href="https://apps.getpebble.com">apps.getpebble.com</a>. Occasionally, websites owned by Rebble may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.</li>
  <li>“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age.</li>
  <li>“Rebble,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Rebble Alliance, LLC, as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</li>
  <li>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. “Content” also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Your Content” is Content that you create or own.</li>
  <li>An “Account” represents your legal relationship with Rebble. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on Rebble.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="b-account-terms">B. Account Terms</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>A human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.</em></p>

<h4 id="1-account-controls">1. Account Controls</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-required-information">2. Required Information</h4>
<p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a <a href="#i-payment">paid Account</a>, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>

<h4 id="3-account-requirements">3. Account Requirements</h4>
<p>We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on Rebble’s Service.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
  <li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account.</li>
  <li>You must be age 13 or older. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
  <li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-user-account-security">4. User Account Security</h4>
<p>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. Rebble cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
  <li>You will promptly notify Rebble if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-additional-terms">5. Additional Terms</h4>
<p>In some situations, third parties’ terms may apply to your use of Rebble. For example, you may download a third party application from the appstore. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties’ terms govern their relationships with you.</p>

<h3 id="c-acceptable-use">C. Acceptable Use</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>Rebble hosts a wide variety of content from all over the worldwide community, and that community only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, <strong>be excellent to each other.</strong></em></p>

<h4 id="1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations">1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h4>
<p>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</p>

<h4 id="2-content-restrictions">2. Content Restrictions</h4>
<p>You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;</li>
  <li>is or contains sexually obscene content;</li>
  <li>is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;</li>
  <li>is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;</li>
  <li>contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or</li>
  <li>infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-conduct-restrictions">3. Conduct Restrictions</h4>
<p>While using Rebble, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including Rebble employees, officers, and agents, or other Rebble Users;</li>
  <li>use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;</li>
  <li>attempt to disrupt or tamper with Rebble’s servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on Rebble’s servers through automated means, or to access Rebble’s Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the Rebble Bug Bounty program);</li>
  <li>impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with Rebble, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site’s purpose; or</li>
  <li>violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person’s personal information without consent.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-services-usage-limits">4. Services Usage Limits</h4>
<p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without Rebble’s express written permission.</p>

<h4 id="5-scraping">5. Scraping</h4>
<p>Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through Rebble’s API. Please see <a href="#g-api-terms">Section g</a> for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from Rebble for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.</li>
  <li>Archivists may scrape Rebble for public data for archival purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may not scrape Rebble for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Rebble users’ personal information.</p>

<p>All use of Rebble data gathered through scraping must comply with the <a href="https://rebble.io/privacy">Rebble Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

<h4 id="6-privacy">6. Privacy</h4>
<p>Misuse of Rebble Users’ Personal Information is prohibited.</p>

<p>Any person, entity, or service collecting data from Rebble must comply with the <a href="https://rebble.io/privacy">Rebble Privacy Statement</a>, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users’ Personal Information (as defined in the Rebble Privacy Statement). If you collect any Rebble User’s Personal Information from Rebble, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Rebble, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and “do not contact” requests from Rebble or Rebble Users.</p>

<h4 id="7-excessive-bandwidth-use">7. Excessive Bandwidth Use</h4>
<p>If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other Rebble customers, we reserve the right to suspend your Account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.</p>

<h4 id="8-user-protection">8. User Protection</h4>
<p>You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.</p>

<h3 id="d-user-generated-content">D. User-Generated Content</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.</em></p>

<h4 id="1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content">1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h4>
<p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>

<h4 id="2-rebble-may-remove-content">2. Rebble May Remove Content</h4>
<p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Rebble terms or policies.</p>

<h4 id="3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants">3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</h4>
<p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you’re posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.</p>

<p>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Rebble Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.6. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Rebble the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.6. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers.</p>

<h4 id="4-license-grant-to-us">4. License Grant to Us</h4>
<p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.</p>

<p>This license does not grant Rebble the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.</p>

<h4 id="5-license-grant-to-other-users">5. License Grant to Other Users</h4>
<p>Any User-Generated Content you post publicly may be viewed by others. By setting your content to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and download it.</p>

<p>If you set your content to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of Rebble a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Rebble Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Rebble as permitted through Rebble’s functionality. You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Rebble Users.</p>

<h4 id="6-moral-rights">6. Moral Rights</h4>
<p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.</p>

<p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Rebble the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>

<h3 id="e-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy">E. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h3>
<p>If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on Rebble violates your rights, please contact us by emailing copyright@rebble.io. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.</p>

<p>We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.</p>

<h3 id="f-intellectual-property-notice">F. Intellectual Property Notice</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.</em></p>

<h4 id="1-rebbles-rights-to-content">1. Rebble’s Rights to Content</h4>
<p>Rebble and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law.</p>

<h4 id="2-rebble-trademarks-and-logos">2. Rebble Trademarks and Logos</h4>
<p>If you’d like to use Rebble’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines.</p>

<h4 id="3-license-to-rebble-policies">3. License to Rebble Policies</h4>
<p>This Agreement is licensed under this <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons Zero license</a>. For details, see our <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/site-policy">site-policy repository</a>.</p>

<h3 id="g-api-terms">G. API Terms</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of Rebble’s APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses Rebble.</em></p>

<h4 id="no-abuse-or-overuse-of-the-api">No Abuse or Overuse of the API</h4>
<p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Rebble via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account’s access to the API. Rebble, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.</p>

<p>You may not share API tokens to exceed Rebble’s rate limitations.</p>

<p>You may not use the API to download data or Content from Rebble for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Rebble users’ personal information.</p>

<p>All use of the Rebble API is subject to these Terms of Service and the <a href="https://rebble.io/privacy">Rebble Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

<p>Rebble may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of Rebble’s Service.</p>

<h3 id="h-third-party-applications">H. Third Party Applications</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You need to follow certain rules if you create an application for other Users, and there are additional Terms that cover the Appstore.</em></p>

<h4 id="1-creating-applications">1. Creating Applications</h4>

<p>If you create a third-party application or other product that collects User Personal Information or User-Generated Content and make it available for other Users, then you must comply with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must comply with this Agreement and the Rebble Privacy Statement.</li>
  <li>Except as otherwise permitted, such as by law or by a license, you must limit your usage of the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you collect to that purpose for which the User has authorized its collection.</li>
  <li>You must take all reasonable security measures appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, presented by processing the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content.</li>
  <li>You must not hold yourself out as collecting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content on Rebble’s behalf, and provide sufficient notice of your privacy practices to the User, such as by posting a privacy policy.</li>
  <li>You must provide Users with a method of deleting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you have collected through Rebble after it is no longer needed for the limited and specified purposes for which the User authorized its collection, except where retention is required by law or otherwise permitted, such as through a license.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-using-third-party-applications">2. Using Third-Party Applications</h4>

<p>You may grant an application authorization to use, access, and disclose your data. However, if you purchase and/or set up an application on your Account, then you will be responsible for the application’s actions that are performed on or through your Account. Please see the <a href="https://rebble.io/privacy">Rebble Privacy Statement</a> for more information about how we share data with applications.</p>

<p><strong>Rebble makes no warranties of any kind in relation to third-party applications and is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access Your Content. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk.</strong></p>

<h3 id="i-payment">I. Payment</h3>
